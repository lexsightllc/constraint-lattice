This project uses a hybrid licensing model to balance open-source collaboration with proprietary protection. The Constraint-Lattice component is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 to ensure downstream sharing of improvements while enabling commercial adoption, and the WildCore component continues to be distributed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 to align with its upstream project's terms. The VarkielAgent component uses two licenses: the Business Source License (BSL) 1.1 for core orchestration and heuristics, which converts to an open-source license after a specified period; and a proprietary license for modules containing advanced semantic integration and domain-specific inference, which remain closed-source to protect commercial interests.
